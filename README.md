# MEAN Stack - Form Application with Login

I am striving to make a simple configurable form application.

Goals of the exercise are:
- Form configured by JSON file
- Instructions on how to deploy it to AWS
- Make it a bit prettier
- Login using Facebook

# Launching application
1. Install npm dependencies using 'npm install' in project folder
1. run using 'node server.js'
